# Project Discription
This project dealt with the classification of secondary emotions. Ten emotions were chosen, determined by their distribution on the Valence-arousal plane as proposed in Russellâ€™s theory of emotion. Five were primary, five were secondary. Two thousand four hundred wav files emulating all ten emotions were provided in the form of the JLCorpus. 11 relevant features were decided based on previous studies. Five from machine learning studies, six from emotion and speech studies. These features were passed into a Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network to obtain a final accuracy of 83% higher than the human average of 40%. Three other models were also created and fitted. Lastly, the model was abstracted into a simple input-output system
